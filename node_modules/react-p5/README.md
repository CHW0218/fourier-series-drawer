## Installation

-   npm

    ```bash
    npm i --save react-p5
    ```

-   yarn

    ```bash
    yarn add react-p5
    ```

## Usage
For Tips and [Advanced Usage](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/integrating-p5-sketches-into-your-react-app-de44a8c74e91) you can read this [Blog Post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/integrating-p5-sketches-into-your-react-app-de44a8c74e91)

#### JavaScript

```js
import React from "react";
import Sketch from "react-p5";

	let x = 50;
	let y = 50;
export default (props) => {
	const setup = (p5, canvasParentRef) => {
		// use parent to render the canvas in this ref
		// (without that p5 will render the canvas outside of your component)
		p5.createCanvas(500, 500).parent(canvasParentRef);
	};

	const draw = (p5) => {
		p5.background(0);
		p5.ellipse(x, y, 70, 70);
		// NOTE: Do not use setState in the draw function or in functions that are executed
		// in the draw function...
		// please use normal variables or class properties for these purposes
		x++;
	};

	return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />;
};
```

#### Typescript

```typescript
import React from "react";
import Sketch from "react-p5";
import p5Types from "p5"; //Import this for typechecking and intellisense

interface ComponentProps {
	//Your component props
}

let x = 50;
	const y = 50;
  
const YourComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = (props: ComponentProps) => {
	

	//See annotations in JS for more information
	const setup = (p5: p5Types, canvasParentRef: Element) => {
		p5.createCanvas(500, 500).parent(canvasParentRef);
	};

	const draw = (p5: p5Types) => {
		p5.background(0);
		p5.ellipse(x, y, 70, 70);
		x++;
	};

	return <Sketch setup={setup} draw={draw} />;
};
```

### Tips
- If you need to get the `browser event object` inside your p5 methods like `mouseClicked` or others you can do it by accessing the second arg.
```js
mouseClicked(_p5, event) {
  console.log(event)
}
```

#### Events that are accessed using props are always attached to `window`. 
That means that events are triggered throughout the whole page ([see the p5 docs for reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/mousePressed)).  

If you would like to attach events only to canvas see the example below.
As an example limiting click events to the canvas:
```javascript
const setup = (p5, canvasParentRef) => {
      cnv = p5.createCanvas(width, height).parent(canvasParentRef)
      cnv.mousePressed((event) => {
        console.log("Clicked on the canvas. Event:", event)
      })
    }
```

#### Using it in an SSR environment (Next.js or Gatsby)

Importing this package for example in a Next.js or Gatsby app may give you this error:

```
ReferenceError: window is not defined
```

This is because importing `p5` requires `window` to be available, and it isn't when server side rendering.

For Next.js we can fix this using [Next.js dynamic imports with No SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr).

```
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Will only import `react-p5` on client-side
const Sketch = dynamic(() => import('react-p5').then((mod) => mod.default), {
  ssr: false,
})
```

For Gatsby we can use loadable-components. See [Gatsby docs: Load client-side dependent components with loadable-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/using-client-side-only-packages/#workaround-4-load-client-side-dependent-components-with-loadable-components).
```
import Loadable from "@loadable/component"

const Sketch = Loadable(
  () => import("react-p5")
);

export default LoadablePage;
```

#### With p5.sound
I frequently see this question even if the implimentation is super simple)) The only needed thing is to import "p5.sound" lib. I created a [Special CodeSandbox DEMO](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-p5-forked-9ixi4?file=/src/index.js) if someone needs to see the implimentation.

#### With p5.sound + next.js (or other framework which has support for SSR)
This question also is frequently asked and the only difference from the normal aprouch is that in SSR mode the react-p5 lib should not be loaded because p5 doesn't support SSR and there is no sense for it to be support. So, if you are using react-p5 plus next.js and you need also p5.sound then try to use dynamic imports as in the code bellow which definitelly will help you.

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Will only import `react-p5` on client-side
const Sketch = dynamic(() => import("react-p5").then((mod) => {
  // importing sound lib ONLY AFTER REACT-P5 is loaded
  require('p5/lib/addons/p5.sound');
  // returning react-p5 default export
  return mod.default
}), {
  ssr: false
});
```
